## Introduction to Pandas DataFrames – Replicating an article in Markdown

This repository contains the following files related to the assignment:

- **Pandas.ipynb** – Main Jupyter Notebook that recreates the “Pandas DataFrames” article using Markdown. It includes all text, images, and the five Python code examples with their outputs.
- **Pandas.webp** – Image file used inside the notebook to visually match the original article layout.
- **dist/Pandas.html** – HTML export of the final notebook, created via “File → Save and Export Notebook As → HTML”. This file can be opened in a web browser without Jupyter.
- **dist/Pandas.webp** – Copy of the image file so that the graphic is displayed correctly when opening `Pandas.html` locally from the `dist` folder.
